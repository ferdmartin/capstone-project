def main():
    '''
    Processes text files containing statements of intent (SOI) from a source 
    directory, copies those with more than 10 characters to a
    target directory, cleans their content, and stores the resulting text,
    along with the corresponding student IDs and submission filenames, in a
    pandas DataFrame that is saved to a CSV file.

    The script reads the content of the SOI files, removes certain lines of
    text based on predefined rules, fixes some formatting issues, replaces
    certain deceptive characters, and writes the cleaned content to new files
    with the same name as the originals but with the suffix "_modified.txt".

    The script also generates a pandas DataFrame with three columns: "ID",
    "Files", and "Text". The "ID" column contains the student IDs extracted
    from the filenames of the processed SOI files, the "Files" column contains
    the submission filenames without the extension, and the "Text" column
    contains the cleaned content of the corresponding files.

    The DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named "df_real.csv" in the same
    directory as the script. The file can be read using the pandas function
    `pd.read_csv("df_real.csv", dtype=str)` with dtype=str to preserve any
    leading zeros in the "ID" column.

    The script could be extended to generate new observations based on each
    real one, by prompting users to generate new statements of intent based on
    the cleaned content in the "Text" column.
